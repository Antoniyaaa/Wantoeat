Wantoeat

Our idea is to help you find out what you can cook with the products you have already available and to save you time wondering. You can select what ingredients you have right now in your home and you will see a list with the meals you can prepare.
You can also sort the recipes by category, such as “meat, eggs, fish, pasta” and so on. If you have any food allergies you can also filter by meals which exclude the allergen(s) you have selected.
We hope that you will find this site useful and encourage you to leave comments under the recipes and to contact us if you have any suggestions for improvement.

For the creation of this project is used template made by Nikolay Kostov:
